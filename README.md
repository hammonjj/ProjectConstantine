# Gameplay Testing Thoughts
Turrets should be statically placed in smart places

The kamikaze enemies don't feel great

~~There needs to be a delay between when a wave ends and when one spawns~~

~~Need time delay upon entering a room before the fight starts~~

Need a momentary delay once enemies spot you until they start shooting
  * This is particularly an issue when the enemies spawn and instantly fire
	* Might just need a quick animation before they begin to fight

Primary attack is a little too long - you can clear some levels without engaging any enemies

~~After hitting an enemy, it should know where you are and start attacking~~

~~Enemies should send an alert event for other enemies that are nearby to help~~
